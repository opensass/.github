# üåê Open SASS - Open Software as Secure Service

Welcome to **Open SASS**! We're a community-driven organization on a mission to deliver high-quality SaaS software written entirely in **Rust**. Our goal? To empower developers to build secure, production-ready software and expand Rust's presence in the web ecosystem.

## üìñ About Us

Open SASS stands for **Open Software as Secure Service**. We believe that production software should be **secure, type-safe**, and **reliable**; Qualities Rust delivers with excellence. By championing Rust for web development, we're helping shape the future of secure, efficient, and high-performance web applications.

## üõ§Ô∏è Our Roadmap

![roadmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00071540-48da-42de-858a-99963d304699)

We are laser-focused on bringing **real-world Rust use cases** to the web. The following a glimpse at what's coming:

- **Full-Stack Apps**: We're building with **Dioxus**, an advanced framework that brings the client and server close together for seamless full-stack Rust applications. It's like the **Flutter of Rust**, supporting mobile and web development alike.
- **Expanding Frameworks**: While we love Dioxus, we're planning to extend support to other WebAssembly frameworks, like **Leptos** and **Yew**.
- **Job Opportunities**: We know Rust web dev jobs are scarce, so we're working toward offering paid gigs for the community. Reaching our financial goal of **$3k** will allow us to hire our first Rust developer.

> **Funding Transparency**: Since GitHub Donations isn't available in our country, we're accepting **crypto donations** to transparently fund our mission. Every bit helps us bring on skilled Rustaceans to develop secure software solutions.
