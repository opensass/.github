# üåê Open SASS

Welcome to **Open SASS**! We're a community-driven organization on a mission to deliver high-quality SaaS software written entirely in **Rust**. Our goal? To empower developers to build secure, production-ready software and expand Rust's presence in the web ecosystem.

## üìñ About Us

Open SASS stands for **Open Software as Secure Service**. We believe that production software should be **secure, type-safe**, and **reliable**; Qualities Rust delivers with excellence. By championing Rust for web development, we're helping shape the future of secure, efficient, and high-performance web applications. **Open SASS** has two primary goals:

1. **To provide a highly customizable UI components library** that meets the following criteria:
   - **WASM Framework Agnostic**: UI components are compatible with any WebAssembly framework (e.g., Yew, Leptos, Dioxus). You can even add support for your preferred framework by submitting a PR for a given component.
   - **CSS Framework Agnostic**: Components work with any CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap) or even without one. You can apply custom CSS, inline styles, or skip using a CSS framework altogether.
   - **Easy Animations**: Effortlessly add animations to components for a polished user experience.
   - **Zero Abstraction**: If you need to modify the underlying implementation of a component, use the [Open SASS CLI](https://crates.io/crates/opensass) to import and customize components directly in your project.

1. **To provide full-Stack Rust projects templates**: We offer **ready-to-use full-stack Rust project templates** that utilize these UI components to help you quickly kickstart your project using the [Open SASS CLI](https://crates.io/crates/opensass).

## üõ§Ô∏è Our Roadmap

We are laser-focused on bringing **real-world Rust use cases** to the web. The following a glimpse at what's coming:

- **Full-Stack Apps**: We're building with **Dioxus**, an advanced framework that brings the client and server close together for seamless full-stack Rust applications. It's like the **Flutter of Rust**, supporting mobile and web development alike.
- **Expanding Frameworks**: While we love Dioxus, we're planning to extend support to other WebAssembly frameworks, like **Leptos** and **Yew**.
- **Job Opportunities**: We know Rust web dev jobs are scarce, so we're working toward offering paid gigs for the community. Reaching our financial goal of **$3k** will allow us to hire our first Rust developer.

> **Funding Transparency**: Since GitHub Donations isn't available in our country, we're accepting **crypto donations** to transparently fund our mission. Every bit helps us bring on skilled Rustaceans to develop secure software solutions.
